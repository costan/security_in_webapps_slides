h1. HTTP Protocol

HTTP 1.0

1. Client opens TCP connection to server
1. Client sends HTTP request
1. Server sends HTTP response
1. Server closes TCP connection
1. Client closes TCP connection

HTTP 1.1
* Optimization: use the same TCP connection for subsequent requests-response pairs
* Still stateless: response determined by last request

h1. HTTP Protocol: Simple Request Example

:code code/http_request.http

h1. HTTP Protocol: Request

# Verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
# Address (part of the URL)
# Request Headers
# Data

h1. HTTP Protocol: Complex Request Example

:code code/http_request_2.http

h1. HTTP Protocol: Response

# Status code and text (200 OK, 404 Not Found, ...)
# Response headers
# Response data

h1. HTTP Protocol: Response Example

:code code/http_response.http

h1. Cookies

Concepts
* Add state to HTTP, which is stateless
* Each DNS domain gets a cookie jar
* Cookie jar: key-value pairs, max size 4kb

Protocol
* HTTP response header sets cookies
* Subsequent HTTP request headers include cookie jar 

h1. Content

* Web page = HTML file + references
* References
** Presentation (style): CSS
** Multimedia: image, video, audio
** Behavior (scripts): JavaScript
** Behavior (plug-ins): Flash etc.

h1. Content Example

:code code/html_page.html[lang=html]
